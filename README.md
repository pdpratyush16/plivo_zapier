# plivo_zapier

A minimal Python integration framework to connect services like Slack, Gmail, Shopify, etc. This project makes it easy to build modular, reusable integrations with support for authentication and common actions.

---

## Features

- Modular structure for integrations (Slack, Gmail, Shopify, etc.)
- Built-in authentication and action support
- Easy to extend and plug new services
- Clean Python packaging setup

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pdpratyush16/plivo_zapier.git
```

## Notes:

Auth and actions have been moved to a single folder for a cleaner implementation. Gmail and Shopify features can be written similarly. A few dummy folders have been created just to know that we could also have some docs, examples and tests for making it a complete project.
